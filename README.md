## Introduction

Prompt-To-Image is designed to generate images based on textual prompts using Hugging Face's powerful models. The project provides a user-friendly interface built with Flutter and ensures a clean and maintainable codebase through the use of clean architecture and the BLoC pattern.

## Features

- Convert text prompts to images using Hugging Face's API
- Clean and modular codebase following clean architecture principles
- State management using the BLoC pattern
- User-friendly Flutter interface
 

The BLoC pattern is used to manage the state and business logic within the presentation layer, making the codebase more testable and maintainable.

## Technology Stack

- **Flutter**: For building the user interface
- **Dart**: The programming language used in Flutter
- **Hugging Face API**: For converting text prompts to images
